Predicting Student Scores with Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict student scores based on the amount of time they spend studying. It utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement the regression model and matplotlib for visualization.

Overview
The student_score_prediction.py script included in this repository loads data on the amount of time students spend studying and their corresponding scores on exams. It splits the data into training and testing sets using train-test split, trains a Linear Regression model on the training data, and evaluates the model's performance on the test data.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yashc1712/Predicting-Student-Scores-using-Linear-Regression.git

Install the required Python libraries

Run the script

Check the coefficient of determination (R^2 score) printed in the terminal to evaluate the performance of the regression model.

Results
The script will output the coefficient of determination (R^2 score), indicating how well the Linear Regression model fits the test data. Additionally, a scatter plot of the training data points along with the regression line will be displayed, providing a visual representation of the relationship between time studied and student scores.
